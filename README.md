- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: Passport JS
- **API Requests**: Axios (for frontend to backend communication)
- **Development Tools**: Nodemon (for backend), Concurrently (to run both backend and frontend simultaneously)
- **Environment Management**: dotenv (for environment variables)
